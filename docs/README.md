### On Gitcoin

[Check out the available open issues on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/explorer/?q=https://github.com/gitcoinco/web).

## What is Gitcoin?

Functionally, the app has several key features:

* Smart Contracts -- Where funded issues are stored and indexed.
* Brochureware -- Describes the project.
* Funded Issue Explorer -- A searchable index of all of the work available in the system.
* Funded Issue Submission / Acceptance flow -- Interface between the application and web3.
* API - the HTTPS API
* Bot - the GitcoinBot

[More about how/why to interact with web3 here](https://gitcoin.co/web3).

Technically, the system is architected:

* __Web3__ The main source of truth for the system is the Ethereum blockchain. Check out the [smart contracts](https://github.com/gitcoinco/smart_contracts).
* __Web2__ This part of the app is built with Python, Django, Postgres, and a handful of other tools that are common in the web2 ecosystem.
* __Web 3 Bridge__ This is the bridge between web3 and the rest of the application. Mostly built in javascript(web3js) and python(web3py).
* __Brochureware__ Just a nice little landing page telling folks what the Gitcoin project is.

### Bounties

This is the high level flow of a bounty on Gitcoin:

<a href="https://www.draw.io/?state=%7B%22ids%22:%5B%221FTatOur159qS8pzBCgIG5E0XdEH8iZF-%22%5D,%22action%22:%22open%22,%22userId%22:%22115514289174042120922%22%7D#G1FTatOur159qS8pzBCgIG5E0XdEH8iZF-"><img src='https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/raw/master/docs/bounty_flow.png' alt="Gitcoin bounty workflow"></a>

Chain of Custody

1. Bounty Funder's Wallet
2. [StandardBounties Smart Contract](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/StandardBounties) deployed at [0x2af47a65da8cd66729b4209c22017d6a5c2d2400](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2af47a65da8cd66729b4209c22017d6a5c2d2400#code)
3. (Submission Made)
4. (Submission Accepted)
5. Recipient's Wallet

Anywhere between 2 and 4 above, Funder may withdraw their funds via 'Cancel Bounty' function for any reason.

We may introduce arbitration at some point in the future.  Until then, we are lucky that Github users are very protective of their reputation, and therefore very kind to each other, and disputes have not generally arisen.

#### Showing Support to Individuals

- via [Tips](https://gitcoin.co/tips)
  - A free, fast way to show immediate gratitude towards an individual via github username or email address

- via [Kudos](https://gitcoin.co/kudos)
  - Showcases special skills and appreciation towards other Gitcoin members.

### Tips

This is the high level flow of a tip on Gitcoin:
