    "en": "BF11 is a system that uses blockchain to build a global stable value payment network, which is currently running on the Ethereum blockchain. Providing everyone with alternative financial and digital business tools, anyone can conduct financial transactions in a fully distributed and relatively inexpensive way. BF11 originated from bitcoin and inherited Nakamoto spirit. When the financial crisis triggered, it also triggered the operation of BF11. In the current financial system, assets such as money are always locked in the chaotic network of indirect ownership and delayed settlement. The transfer of assets from one party to another usually requires peer-to-peer interaction between multiple intermediaries and reconciliation of duplicate ledgers. This is costly in many ways, including time, cost, transparency, security, irreversibility, etc.",
    "zh": "BF11是一个应用区块链来搭建全球稳定价值支付网络的系统,目前是在以太坊区块链上运行。为 每个人提供可替代的金融和数字商业工具,任何人都可以以一种完全分布式和比较便宜的方式来进行金融交易。BF11 起源于比特币，继承了中本聪精神，在金融危机触发时，也触发了 BF11的运行。当前的金融体系中，货币等资产总被锁定在间接所有权和延迟结算的混乱网络中。 将资产从一方转移到另一方通常需要多个中介机构之间的点对点互动以及重复分类 帐的核对。这在许多方面都消耗巨大，其中包括时间，成本，透明度，安全性，不可逆性等。"
