<h3 id='faq' class="text-center my-5">FAQ</h3>

<div class="mb-3 faq-item">
  <h5 class="accordion">{% trans "What are time tokens?" %}</h5>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Time tokens are ERC20 tokens tied to different Gitcoin users. They represent a claim over listed uses like time, work and feedback. Each time token is unique, and different tokens may be redeemed for specific uses.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-3 faq-item">
  <h5 class="accordion">Where do I see a user’s time token?</h5>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>The best place to see a user’s token is directly on their Gitcoin Profile, under the Time Token tab at the top of the page. This shows you how much their tokens cost, and exactly what they can be used for.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-3 faq-item">
  <h5 class="accordion">How do I use a time token?</h5>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Once you’ve acquired a time token, you’ll need to submit a redemption request. 
    This request can be used on any of the Creators listed uses, and only for those uses. 
    Please note that it’s up to the creator to determine whether or not your request is appropriate, so please give them 24-48 hours to respond to your request.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-3 faq-item">
  <h5 class="accordion">What happens to my time tokens when they are used?</h5>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>When a Creator accepts your request, you are responsible for marking it as complete. Upon marking a request as complete, you will be prompted to complete a transaction that sends the amount of time tokens used back to the Creator's sale contract.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-3 faq-item">
  <h5 class="accordion">A Creator accepted my request and did not meet my expectations - What should I do?</h5>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Seeing as you have the power to Complete a request (thus transferring the time tokens) you can always Cancel the redemption to avoid having your tokens revoked without work being performed. We strongly recommend trying to resolve this issue directly with the Creator via Chat as they are unlikely to accept future requests from you if you do not complete your existing requests first.</p>
