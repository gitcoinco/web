# Gitcoin Grants

## What are Gitcoin grants?

Gitcoin Grants allows developers like you to get recurring cashflow for working on projects you’re most excited about.

You can also support exciting projects that you love.

During matching grants rounds [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) is used to increase the impact of every donation. More info on grants can be found [here](https://gitcoin.co/grants/quickstart).
