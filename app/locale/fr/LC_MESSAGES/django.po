"              <p>\n"
"                Gitcoin Holdings, Inc. (“Gitcoin”) is a blockchain-based "
"incentivization toolkit for Open Source Software allowing Users to interact "
"with Gitcoin. “Tasks” means any service a Site participant requests or "
"performs. Site participants may consist of (a) those who post Tasks to "
"Gitcoin, make Grants (as defined below) to Hunters, sponsor virtual "
"hackathon events in which multiple Hunters may participate (“Hackathons”) or "
"manage a community (“Tribes”) (such participant, individually a “Poster,” "
"collectively the “Posters”); (b) those who fulfill Tasks (individually a "
"“Hunter” or collectively the “Hunters”); (c) those who interact with the "
"Gitcoin site but do not post or fulfill Tasks (a “Visitor”); (d) those who "
"buy Kudos or other UGC (as defined below) (individually a “Buyer,” "
"collectively the “Buyers”); (e) and those who create or sell Kudos or other "
"UGC (individually a “Seller,” collectively the “Sellers” and, together with "
"Posters, Hunters, Visitors and Buyers, “Users”). The Gitcoin website "
"(https://gitcoin.co/, the “Site”) serves as a registration portal, product "
"offering, and an overview of the Gitcoin services. The site also includes "
"text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information. "
"The Site allows Posters to fund and post Tasks for Hunters to resolve, "
"allows Posters to fund Grants for Hunters, allows Posters to sponsor "
"Hackathons, allows Hunters to resolve Tasks and participate in Hackathons, "
"and allows Buyers and Sellers to buy and sell (collectively, the “Service "
"Offerings”). The Site and any other features, tools, materials, or services "
"offered from time to time by Gitcoin, including without limitation the "
"Service Offerings, is referred to here as the “Service.” Please read these "
"Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Terms of Use”) carefully before using the "
"Service. By using or otherwise accessing the Services, or clicking to accept "
"or agree to these Terms where that option is made available, you (x) accept "
"and agree to these Terms, (y) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and "
"other handling of information as described in our <a target=\"_blank\" rel="
"\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://gitcoin.co/legal/cookie\">Privacy Policy</a> "
"and (z) any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation issued "
"by Gitcoin from time to time. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY "
"NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">2. MODIFICATIONS OF TERMS OF USE</"
"h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                Except for Section 25, providing for binding arbitration and "
"waiver of class action rights, Gitcoin reserves the right, at its sole "
"discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Use at any time. The most "
"current version of these Terms will be posted on our Site. You shall be "
"responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. "
"Use of the Services by you after any modification to the Terms constitutes "
"your acceptance of the Terms of Use as modified.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">3. ELIGIBILITY</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                You represent and warrant that you: (a) are of legal age to "
"form a binding contract; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed "
"from using our Services; and (c) have full power and authority to enter into "
"this agreement and in doing so will not violate any other agreement to which "
"you are a party. If you are registering to use the Services on behalf of a "
"legal entity, you further represent and warrant that (x) such legal entity "
"is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the "
"jurisdiction of its organization, and (y) you are duly authorized by such "

"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">4. ROLE OF GITCOIN</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                You expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: the "
"Site is merely a platform through which Posters, Hunters, Buyers and Sellers "
"conduct transactions. Unless participating on the Site as a Poster or a "
"Seller, Gitcoin is not involved in the transactions, and has no control over "
"the quality, safety, or legality of Tasks or consideration for Tasks, the "
"ability of Hunters to perform Tasks to Posters’ satisfaction, or the ability "
"of Posters to pay for Tasks. You are not an employee of Gitcoin, and Gitcoin "
"does not, in any way, screen, supervise, direct, or control Hunters or "
"services performed for or delivered to Posters  (“Hunter Services”). Gitcoin "
"will not have any liability or obligations under or related to Service "
"Contracts (defined below) for any acts or omissions by you or other Users. "
"Gitcoin has no control over Hunters or the Hunter Services offered or "
"rendered by Hunters and Gitcoin makes no representations as to the "
"reliability, capability, or qualifications of any Hunter or the quality, "
"security, or legality of any Hunter Services, and Gitcoin disclaims any and "
"all liability relating thereto. Gitcoin has no control over Buyers and "
"Sellers and Gitcoin makes no representations as to the quality or legality "
"of any UGC created or sold by Sellers, and Gitcoin disclaims any and all "
"liability relating thereto. Use of the Site is at your own risk. Because "
"Gitcoin is not a party to the transactions between Posters and Hunters or "
"between Buyers and Sellers, Gitcoin is not responsible for (i) resolving any "
"disputes between participants related to any Tasks or (ii) any tax "
"liabilities that may arise in a transaction between participants.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">5. GITCOIN POSTERS</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                As a Poster, you agree that: (a) you will interact with "
"Hunters in a professional and courteous manner, and accurately describe your "
"Task; (b) you may only use the Site for business, commercial, or research "
"purposes; (c) you may not have Hunters perform Tasks through venues other "
"than the Site; (d) payment will be issued and remitted to Hunters upon your "
"approval of Task; (e) payment is not refundable; (f) you will not reject "
"Tasks performed by Hunters without good cause; and (g) you will not post a "
"Task that violates any part of Section 14 of the Terms.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">6. GITCOIN HUNTERS</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                As a Hunter, you agree that:\n"
"                (a) you will interact with Posters in a professional and "
"courteous manner, and provide reasonably requested information in connection "
"with your performance of Tasks; (b) you will perform Tasks in a competent "
"and workmanlike manner; (c) you will supply complete, accurate, non-"
"malicious information for all Tasks you perform; (d) you will not perform "
"Tasks through venues other than the Site; (e) you will not submit anything "
"to Poster that violates Section 14 of the Terms; and (f) Posters may reject "
"Tasks you perform for good cause and currently there is no way for a Hunter "
"to dispute any rejection of a submission made through the Site, meaning you "
"may not be paid if a Poster rejects your submission.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">7. GITCOIN FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                Unless otherwise agreed between you and Gitcoin in a "
"separate order form, which is obtainable by contacting us directly, all "
"Tasks on the Site are subject to a ten (10) percent listing fee, calculated "
"as 10%% of the total Task value (the “Listing Fee”) payable to Gitcoin. The "
"Listing Fee shall be paid by the Poster, and shall be due upon a Poster "
"submitting a Task to the Site.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                The Listing Fee is refundable to the Poster solely upon the "
"satisfaction of either of the following limited circumstances:\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <ol>\n"
"                <li>The Task has not been filled by a Hunter prior to "
"Gitcoin’s receipt of a written request for a refund from a Poster. The "
"Poster must submit a refund request to Gitcoin within 90 days from the date "
"of posting such Task in order to be eligible for a refund.</li>\n"
"                <li>The Poster is dissatisfied by work submitted by a Hunter "
"and submits a request for review within 30 days of completion of the Task by "
"a Hunter. In these instances, the Poster shall submit a written request for "
"review to Gitcoin, who will in its sole discretion determine whether or not "
"the Poster is eligible for a refund of the Transaction Fee.</li>\n"
"              </ol>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">8. GITCOIN RECURRING GRANTS</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                In addition to Section 5, but notwithstanding anything to "
"the contrary therein, if you use the Site to make a grant (a “Grant”) to a "
"Hunter, you agree that: (a) the Hunter has broad discretion in performing "
"the Task described on its project page on the Site (the “Grant Project "
"Page”), including what, how and when they perform such Task, and how they "
"use the Grant; (b) the Grant will be made to the Hunter on a recurring "
"basis, commencing with the first contribution at the time that you agree to "
"make the Grant and recurring based on the frequency specified by the Hunter "
"on the Grant Project Page; (c) the Hunter may change the Task, including "
"without limitation the scope and timeline and the frequency of "
"contributions; (d) Grant contributions will be issued and remitted to the "
"Hunter prior to the Hunter completing a Task; (e) the Grant is not "
"refundable; (f) you will not have the ability on the Site to dispute or "
"reject Tasks performed by Hunters, but you may terminate future Grant "
"contributions to the extent they have not been made; and (g) you and Hunter "
"are responsible for any tax liabilities in connection with your "
"transaction.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                In addition to Section 6, but notwithstanding anything to "
"the contrary therein, if you use the Site to accept a Grant from Posters, "
"you agree that: (a) you will use the Grant to perform the Task described on "
"your Grant Project Page; (b) you will notify Posters of any material changes "
"to your Grant Project Page or the Task, including without limitation the "

"with all applicable laws and registration requirements, including those "
"applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours regulations; "
"(b) these Terms do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, "
"franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you and Poster, or you "
"and Gitcoin; (iii) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent "
"of a Poster or Gitcoin; (iv) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits "
"that a Poster or Gitcoin may make available to its employees, such as "
"vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including group health "
"insurance or retirement benefits; and (v) you are not eligible to recover "
"worker's compensation benefits in the event of injury. As an independent "
"contractor, Hunter is free at all times to provide Hunter Services to "
"persons or businesses other than Poster, including any competitor of Poster. "
"Hunter does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether "
"implied or express) contracts on behalf of Poster or Gitcoin. As a Poster, "
"you will not engage a Hunter in any way that may jeopardize that Hunter's "
"status as an independent contractor performing Tasks for you. Posters may "
"not require an exclusive relationship.\n"

"              <p>\n"
"                As used herein, a “Service Contract” means, as applicable, "
"the unilateral contractual provisions created by Poster that govern the "
"Hunter Services to be performed by Hunter for Poster for a particular Task "
"posted to the Site and which will typically include a description of the "
"Task or Tasks to be completed, the amount and type of currency as "
"compensation, and the deadline.  You acknowledge and agree that Gitcoin is "
"not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the formation of a Service "
"Contract between any Posters and Hunters will not, under any circumstance, "
"create an employment or other service relationship between Gitcoin and "
"Poster or Gitcoin and Hunter.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">12. GITCOIN TIME TOKENS</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                Gitcoin offers its Time Token minting technology to allow "
"users to independently create and distribute their own personal ERC20 "
"tokens. After generating the tokens, users can transfer their time tokens "
"for a fixed price to purchasers who are users on the platform. In return, "
"the purchaser will get access to 1 hour of time from the seller. All funds "
"are transferred directly from the purchaser to the seller. The seller "
"transfers the time token directly from the time token contract to the wallet "
"of the purchaser. Gitcoin does not take custody of the token or the funds "
"and currently does not collect any fees for providing this technology. "
"Sellers shall provide a description of the services that a purchaser may "
"redeem the Seller’s time tokens for. Users agree to refrain from "
"participating in any illegal activities in all applicable jurisdictions.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">13. PAYMENT</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                In order to use Site Services, each User must provide its "
"Ethereum wallet address. The Site and the Site Services operate with Ether "
"or ERC20 compatible tokens. Payment to Hunters will occur upon Poster’s "
"acceptance of Hunter’s Work Product or, in the case of a Grant, immediately "
"upon a Poster agreeing to contribute a Grant to the Hunter and upon each "
"payment cycle thereafter. Acceptance of a Hunter’s Work Product is at the "
"sole discretion of the Poster.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <h2 class=\"font-title\">14. RESTRICTIONS ON USE</h2>\n"

"ACTION WAIVER</h2>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY "
"AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                25.1. Initial Dispute Resolution <br>\n"
"                The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly "
"to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good "
"faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a "
"lawsuit or arbitration.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                25.2. Binding Arbitration <br>\n"
"                If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a "
"period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the "
"Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate "
"binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the "
"terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating "
"to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the "
"parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall "
"be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American "
"Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial "
"Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related "
"disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any "
"rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, "
"and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive "
"authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the "
"interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, "
"including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms "
"are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The "
"arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in "
"a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and "
"binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of "
"competent jurisdiction. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory "
"provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. "
"They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration "
"could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more "
"limited in arbitration than in court.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                25.3. Location <br>\n"
"                Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree "
"to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New "
"York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings "
"pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the "
"award entered by the arbitrator.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                25.4. Class Action Waiver <br>\n"
"                The parties further agree that any arbitration or other "
"permitted action shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and "
"not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties "
"expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class "
"basis. YOU AND GITCOIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER "
"ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS "
"MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or "
"arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this "
"paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can "
"proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above "
"shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be "
"deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                25.5. Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and "
"Small Claims Court Claims <br>\n"
"                Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all "
"disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or "
"federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual "
"property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and "
"trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also "
"seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope "
"of that court’s jurisdiction.\n"
"              </p>\n"
"              <p>\n"
"                25.6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out <br>\n"
