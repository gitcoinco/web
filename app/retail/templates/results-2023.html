      <p>
        We believe that positive change in the world starts with thriving communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started building tools in 2017 with the goal of funding underpaid developers working on the open-source software the internet runs on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Open Source Software is a public good -- something we all benefit from -- like clean air and water or scientific knowledge.  Because we all benefit, it's hard to charge any individual or group and therefore it's hard to get paid for working on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the ecosystem of the Ethereum blockchain, we've created ways for builders to earn a living while working for the public.  Through our software, people in a community can support the public goods that matter most to them, and help ensure their builders thrive.
