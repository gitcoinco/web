Day 3: Leveraging the community

Gitcoin Core is 11 team members, yet we’ve seen contributions from well over 100 developers using Gitcoin. We’d like to see you do the same!  Here’s how to leverage a firehose of developer talent to do more, faster. 

Posting a bounty can be done in 90 seconds, once you know Gitcoin is an option to accelerate your development.  Adding bounties to an existing project is like adding icing to a cake.  We take what’s already great about OSS (mission,  freedom, and great people) and add financial incentivization, a home base for projects seeking contributors, funding for developer, and community.

Alongside posting bounties on the Issue Explorer, Gitcoin offers two complimentary products for open source software enthusiasts. 

Codefund: Sustain your OSS project with ethical advertising

Gitcoin Kudos: Have a contributor that’s doing fantastic work? Send them a token of appreciation using Kudos! Here’s one for you :) 

Gitcoin Grants: Recurring funding for open source projects.

Community is what makes Open Source work.  A strong OSS community is inclusive, helpful, and mission-oriented. The Gitcoin community is 10,000 software developers who are focused on the tooling for the new world. Is there a chance that your next career connection could come from the Gitcoin community?
