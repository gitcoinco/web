              <p>Gitcoin Terms of Use</p>
              <p>Last updated: May 11, 2021</p>
              <p>
                IMPORTANT NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION
                AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN SECTION 25.
                PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
              <p>
                Gitcoin Holdings, Inc. (“Gitcoin”) is a blockchain-based incentivization toolkit for Open Source Software allowing Users to interact with Gitcoin. “Tasks” means any service a Site participant requests or performs. Site participants may consist of (a) those who post Tasks to Gitcoin, make Grants (as defined below) to Hunters, sponsor virtual hackathon events in which multiple Hunters may participate (“Hackathons”) or manage a community (“Tribes”) (such participant, individually a “Poster,” collectively the “Posters”); (b) those who fulfill Tasks (individually a “Hunter” or collectively the “Hunters”); (c) those who interact with the Gitcoin site but do not post or fulfill Tasks (a “Visitor”); (d) those who buy Kudos or other UGC (as defined below) (individually a “Buyer,” collectively the “Buyers”); (e) and those who create or sell Kudos or other UGC (individually a “Seller,” collectively the “Sellers” and, together with Posters, Hunters, Visitors and Buyers, “Users”). The Gitcoin website (https://gitcoin.co/, the “Site”) serves as a registration portal, product offering, and an overview of the Gitcoin services. The site also includes text, images, audio, code and other materials or third party information. The Site allows Posters to fund and post Tasks for Hunters to resolve, allows Posters to fund Grants for Hunters, allows Posters to sponsor Hackathons, allows Hunters to resolve Tasks and participate in Hackathons, and allows Buyers and Sellers to buy and sell (collectively, the “Service Offerings”). The Site and any other features, tools, materials, or services offered from time to time by Gitcoin, including without limitation the Service Offerings, is referred to here as the “Service.” Please read these Terms of Use (the “Terms” or “Terms of Use”) carefully before using the Service. By using or otherwise accessing the Services, or clicking to accept or agree to these Terms where that option is made available, you (x) accept and agree to these Terms, (y) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://gitcoin.co/legal/cookie">Privacy Policy</a> and (z) any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation issued by Gitcoin from time to time. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">2. MODIFICATIONS OF TERMS OF USE</h2>
              <p>
                Except for Section 25, providing for binding arbitration and waiver of class action rights, Gitcoin reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Use at any time. The most current version of these Terms will be posted on our Site. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Use of the Services by you after any modification to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms of Use as modified.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">3. ELIGIBILITY</h2>
              <p>
                You represent and warrant that you: (a) are of legal age to form a binding contract; (b) have not previously been suspended or removed from using our Services; and (c) have full power and authority to enter into this agreement and in doing so will not violate any other agreement to which you are a party. If you are registering to use the Services on behalf of a legal entity, you further represent and warrant that (x) such legal entity is duly organized and validly existing under the applicable laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and (y) you are duly authorized by such legal entity to act on its behalf.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">4. ROLE OF GITCOIN</h2>
              <p>
                You expressly acknowledge, agree, and understand that: the Site is merely a platform through which Posters, Hunters, Buyers and Sellers conduct transactions. Unless participating on the Site as a Poster or a Seller, Gitcoin is not involved in the transactions, and has no control over the quality, safety, or legality of Tasks or consideration for Tasks, the ability of Hunters to perform Tasks to Posters’ satisfaction, or the ability of Posters to pay for Tasks. You are not an employee of Gitcoin, and Gitcoin does not, in any way, screen, supervise, direct, or control Hunters or services performed for or delivered to Posters  (“Hunter Services”). Gitcoin will not have any liability or obligations under or related to Service Contracts (defined below) for any acts or omissions by you or other Users. Gitcoin has no control over Hunters or the Hunter Services offered or rendered by Hunters and Gitcoin makes no representations as to the reliability, capability, or qualifications of any Hunter or the quality, security, or legality of any Hunter Services, and Gitcoin disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. Gitcoin has no control over Buyers and Sellers and Gitcoin makes no representations as to the quality or legality of any UGC created or sold by Sellers, and Gitcoin disclaims any and all liability relating thereto. Use of the Site is at your own risk. Because Gitcoin is not a party to the transactions between Posters and Hunters or between Buyers and Sellers, Gitcoin is not responsible for (i) resolving any disputes between participants related to any Tasks or (ii) any tax liabilities that may arise in a transaction between participants.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">5. GITCOIN POSTERS</h2>
              <p>
                As a Poster, you agree that: (a) you will interact with Hunters in a professional and courteous manner, and accurately describe your Task; (b) you may only use the Site for business, commercial, or research purposes; (c) you may not have Hunters perform Tasks through venues other than the Site; (d) payment will be issued and remitted to Hunters upon your approval of Task; (e) payment is not refundable; (f) you will not reject Tasks performed by Hunters without good cause; and (g) you will not post a Task that violates any part of Section 14 of the Terms.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">6. GITCOIN HUNTERS</h2>
              <p>
                As a Hunter, you agree that:
                (a) you will interact with Posters in a professional and courteous manner, and provide reasonably requested information in connection with your performance of Tasks; (b) you will perform Tasks in a competent and workmanlike manner; (c) you will supply complete, accurate, non-malicious information for all Tasks you perform; (d) you will not perform Tasks through venues other than the Site; (e) you will not submit anything to Poster that violates Section 14 of the Terms; and (f) Posters may reject Tasks you perform for good cause and currently there is no way for a Hunter to dispute any rejection of a submission made through the Site, meaning you may not be paid if a Poster rejects your submission.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">7. GITCOIN FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise agreed between you and Gitcoin in a separate order form, which is obtainable by contacting us directly, all Tasks on the Site are subject to a ten (10) percent listing fee, calculated as 10% of the total Task value (the “Listing Fee”) payable to Gitcoin. The Listing Fee shall be paid by the Poster, and shall be due upon a Poster submitting a Task to the Site.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Listing Fee is refundable to the Poster solely upon the satisfaction of either of the following limited circumstances:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>The Task has not been filled by a Hunter prior to Gitcoin’s receipt of a written request for a refund from a Poster. The Poster must submit a refund request to Gitcoin within 90 days from the date of posting such Task in order to be eligible for a refund.</li>
                <li>The Poster is dissatisfied by work submitted by a Hunter and submits a request for review within 30 days of completion of the Task by a Hunter. In these instances, the Poster shall submit a written request for review to Gitcoin, who will in its sole discretion determine whether or not the Poster is eligible for a refund of the Transaction Fee.</li>
              </ol>
              <h2 class="font-title">8. GITCOIN RECURRING GRANTS</h2>
              <p>
                In addition to Section 5, but notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein, if you use the Site to make a grant (a “Grant”) to a Hunter, you agree that: (a) the Hunter has broad discretion in performing the Task described on its project page on the Site (the “Grant Project Page”), including what, how and when they perform such Task, and how they use the Grant; (b) the Grant will be made to the Hunter on a recurring basis, commencing with the first contribution at the time that you agree to make the Grant and recurring based on the frequency specified by the Hunter on the Grant Project Page; (c) the Hunter may change the Task, including without limitation the scope and timeline and the frequency of contributions; (d) Grant contributions will be issued and remitted to the Hunter prior to the Hunter completing a Task; (e) the Grant is not refundable; (f) you will not have the ability on the Site to dispute or reject Tasks performed by Hunters, but you may terminate future Grant contributions to the extent they have not been made; and (g) you and Hunter are responsible for any tax liabilities in connection with your transaction.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to Section 6, but notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein, if you use the Site to accept a Grant from Posters, you agree that: (a) you will use the Grant to perform the Task described on your Grant Project Page; (b) you will notify Posters of any material changes to your Grant Project Page or the Task, including without limitation the scope and timeline and the frequency of contributions; and (c) you and Posters are responsible for any tax liabilities in connection with your transaction.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">9. WORK PRODUCT AND WORK FOR HIRE</h2>
              <p>
                Hunter will perform the Hunter Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and will timely deliver any agreed upon tangible or intangible results or deliverables, including, but not limited to, configurations, computer programs, software, applications, or other information, and any intellectual property developed in connection therewith (“Work Product”). Where applicable, the Work Product must be submitted to Poster in open source format.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any Work Product from Tasks performed as a Hunter is a "work made for hire" for the benefit of the Poster. Upon Hunter’s receipt of full payment from Poster, the Work Product, including without limitation all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction (“Intellectual Property Rights”) in the Work Product, will be the sole and exclusive property of Poster, and Poster will be deemed to be the author thereof. If Hunter has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product that are not owned by Poster upon Hunter’s receipt of payment from Client, Hunter hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth above, Hunter retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Poster’s ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights. Hunter hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hunter agrees that it will not incorporate into Work Product or otherwise supply Poster any deliverable for which the use or distribution of the code will create (or purport to create) obligations for Poster to grant any rights or immunities under Poster’s intellectual property to a third-party, including without limitation any obligation that the Work Product or Poster software combined with, derived from, or distributed with such Work Product (a) be disclosed or distributed in source code form, (b) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or (c) be redistributable at no charge.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">10. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS</h2>
              <p>
                Hunters perform Tasks for Posters in their personal capacity as an independent contractor and not as an employee of a Poster or Gitcoin. As a Hunter, you agree that: (a) you are responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements, including those applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours regulations; (b) these Terms do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you and Poster, or you and Gitcoin; (iii) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of a Poster or Gitcoin; (iv) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that a Poster or Gitcoin may make available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including group health insurance or retirement benefits; and (v) you are not eligible to recover worker's compensation benefits in the event of injury. As an independent contractor, Hunter is free at all times to provide Hunter Services to persons or businesses other than Poster, including any competitor of Poster. Hunter does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of Poster or Gitcoin. As a Poster, you will not engage a Hunter in any way that may jeopardize that Hunter's status as an independent contractor performing Tasks for you. Posters may not require an exclusive relationship.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">11. GITCOIN CONTRACTS</h2>
              <p>
                As used herein, a “Service Contract” means, as applicable, the unilateral contractual provisions created by Poster that govern the Hunter Services to be performed by Hunter for Poster for a particular Task posted to the Site and which will typically include a description of the Task or Tasks to be completed, the amount and type of currency as compensation, and the deadline.  You acknowledge and agree that Gitcoin is not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the formation of a Service Contract between any Posters and Hunters will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Gitcoin and Poster or Gitcoin and Hunter.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">12. GITCOIN TIME TOKENS</h2>
              <p>
                Gitcoin offers its Time Token minting technology to allow users to independently create and distribute their own personal ERC20 tokens. After generating the tokens, users can transfer their time tokens for a fixed price to purchasers who are users on the platform. In return, the purchaser will get access to 1 hour of time from the seller. All funds are transferred directly from the purchaser to the seller. The seller transfers the time token directly from the time token contract to the wallet of the purchaser. Gitcoin does not take custody of the token or the funds and currently does not collect any fees for providing this technology. Sellers shall provide a description of the services that a purchaser may redeem the Seller’s time tokens for. Users agree to refrain from participating in any illegal activities in all applicable jurisdictions.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">13. PAYMENT</h2>
              <p>
                In order to use Site Services, each User must provide its Ethereum wallet address. The Site and the Site Services operate with Ether or ERC20 compatible tokens. Payment to Hunters will occur upon Poster’s acceptance of Hunter’s Work Product or, in the case of a Grant, immediately upon a Poster agreeing to contribute a Grant to the Hunter and upon each payment cycle thereafter. Acceptance of a Hunter’s Work Product is at the sole discretion of the Poster.
              </p>
              <h2 class="font-title">14. RESTRICTIONS ON USE</h2>
              <p>
                Unless otherwise expressly authorized in these Terms of Use or on the Site, you may not take any action to interfere with the Site or any other user’s use of the Site or decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any content or other products or processes accessible through the Site, nor insert any code or product or manipulate the content in any way that affects any User’s experience. While using the Site you are required to comply with all applicable statutes, orders, regulations, rules, and other laws. In addition, we expect users of the Website to respect the rights and dignity of others. Your use of the Site is conditioned on your compliance with the rules of conduct set forth in this Section.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may not use, or cause or encourage others to use, Gitcoin for any illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing, or objectionable activities. Here is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited activities:

                  <li>Tasks intended to promote a site, service or opinion (e.g., don't ask Hunters to write fake news or reviews)</li>
                  <li>Infringing or misappropriating the rights of others, including Tasks that require violating the terms of any website, product, or service</li>
                  <li>Posting or transmitting any content that is illegal, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable, including content that constitutes child pornography, relates to bestiality, or depicts non-consensual sex acts</li>
                  <li>Disrupting, manipulating, or impairing the operation of the Gitcoin Site (e.g., do not try to "game" search results for Tasks)</li>
                  <li>Scraping data or content from the Gitcoin Site</li>
                  <li>Creating a security risk for Gitcoin or any Gitcoin User, including posting Tasks that require downloading software that contains harmful content or malicious code</li>
                  <li>Performing or requesting Tasks through venues other than the Gitcoin Site</li>
                </ul>
              <p>

              <h2 class="font-title">15. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER</h2>

              </p>

              <p>
                PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT
              </p>
              <p>
                25.1. Initial Dispute Resolution <br>
                The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
              </p>
              <p>
                25.2. Binding Arbitration <br>
                If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
              </p>
              <p>
                25.3. Location <br>
                Binding arbitration shall take place in New York. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
              </p>
              <p>
                25.4. Class Action Waiver <br>
                The parties further agree that any arbitration or other permitted action shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND GITCOIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
              </p>
              <p>
                25.5. Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims <br>
                Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
              </p>
              <p>
                25.6. 30-Day Right to Opt Out <br>
                You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Gitcoin Holdings, 2770 Arapahoe Rd. Ste 132-1015 Lafayette, CO 80026 and via email at privacy@gitcoin.co, with subject line “Gitcoin LEGAL OPT OUT”. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Gitcoin also will not be bound by them.
              </p>
              <p>
                25.7. Changes to this Section <br>
                Gitcoin will provide 60-days’ notice of any changes to this Section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day. For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Gitcoin agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available. The Terms and the relationship between you and Gitcoin shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.
